# Act [#]: [Level Name] – The Story Behind the Puzzle

<!-- Example: "Act I: Dawn in Dock-Ward – The Story Behind the Puzzle" -->
<!-- Example: "Act III: The Looking-Glass – When Rivals Steal Your Steam" -->

## The Hook (Story Beat)

[Start with a narrative excerpt from the level—immerse readers in Aetherford.]

<!-- Example: "Debt collectors at the door. Your foundry-barge lists in the canal, boilers cold. Master Brass taps his cane: 'One week, Mechanist. Show me a working Signal Loom, or this barge is mine.'" -->

## The Setting

[Describe where/when this level occurs in the campaign. Set the steampunk scene.]

**Act**: [Act number and theme]  
**Location**: [e.g., Your foundry-barge, The Exposition Hall, Lady Kessington's Atelier]  
**Stakes**: [What's at risk for the player character]

<!-- Example:
**Act**: Act I (Cinders & Sums)  
**Location**: Your rundown foundry-barge, moored in Dock-Ward  
**Stakes**: Lose this demo, lose your inheritance and workshop
-->

## The Characters

[Who appears in this level's narrative? Rivals, mentors, inspectors?]

### [Character Name]

[Brief description, motivation, voice/tone]

<!-- Example:
### Master Brass (Inspectorate)
The Guild examiner who could save or sink you. Speaks in clipped efficiency: "Your Manometer sings, Mechanist. But show me its song on unseen ledgers."
-->

### [Character Name]

[Brief description, motivation, voice/tone]

## The Challenge (Game Design)

[What puzzle does this level present? Connect narrative stakes to gameplay.]

### Level Objective

[What the player must build/achieve]

<!-- Example: "Build a Signal Loom that matches three target patterns. Your Weight Wheels must learn the correct scalings." -->

### Parts Introduced

[New components available in this level]

<!-- Example: 
- **Weight Wheel**: Adjustable multiplication; learns via SGD
- **Entropy Manometer**: Measures how wrong your output is
- **Stochastic Sal (SGD Apprentice)**: Applies gradient adjustments
-->

### The Constraint Story

[How do the budget/resource limits tie into the narrative?]

<!-- Example: "You're broke—only 500 brass to spend. House Voltaic can throw infinite coal at their machines. You have to be smarter." -->

## The AI Mirror

[What real-world AI challenge does this level's story parallel?]

<!-- Example: "Energy scarcity → compute budgets. In real ML, you can't always throw more GPUs at a problem. Sometimes you need a clever architecture instead of raw power." -->

### Modern Parallel

[Connect to today's AI landscape]

<!-- Example: "This mirrors how startups compete with BigTech. OpenAI has datacenter scale; you don't. But efficient models (like DistilBERT or Mistral 7B) prove that smart beats big." -->

## The Story Beats

[Outline the narrative arc through this level—beginning, middle, end]

### Opening: [Trigger Event]

[What happens to start this level?]

### Rising Action: [Challenge]

[Obstacles, rival interference, resource pressure]

### Climax: [The Demo/Test]

[The moment of truth—does your contraption work?]

### Resolution: [Outcome]

[What changes? New reputation, unlocked parts, rival response?]

<!-- Example:
### Resolution: Master Brass Approves
"Adequate, Mechanist. Your Loom sings true—on these cards, at least. But generalization is the real test. Come find me when you're ready for the Inspectorate Trials."

The Penny Clarion prints: "Dock-Ward Dark Horse Shows Promise."
-->

## The Dialog Snippets

[Key quotes that capture character voices and themes]

- **[Character]**: "[Quote]"
- **[Character]**: "[Quote]"
- **You (the player)**: "[Optional response or internal thought]"

## Between Levels: The Transition

[What narrative connector leads to the next level?]

<!-- Example: "A pneumatic tube arrives: House Voltaic challenges you to a public demo. The game is on." -->

## Why This Story Matters

[Reflect on how narrative enhances the educational goal]

<!-- Example: "The debt collector isn't just flavor—it creates urgency. Players feel the pressure of limited resources, which mirrors real ML constraints. Story makes the learning stick." -->
