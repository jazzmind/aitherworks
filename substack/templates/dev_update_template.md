# [Week #]: [Catchy Title About What You Built]

<!-- Example: "Week 4: Prototyping the Signal Loom" or "Week 7: When the Manometer Started Hissing" -->

## The Hook (Problem or Win)

[Start with a quick win or challenge from this week. Make it relatable and human.]

<!-- Example: "This week, I built the first AI mechanic—and hit a bug that taught me about gradients." -->
<!-- Example: "Ever try to visualize backpropagation with steampunk metaphors? Turns out it's harder than it sounds." -->

## What I Built

[Detail the progress this week. Be specific but accessible.]

### Technical Details

[Code snippets, YAML examples, GDScript functions. Show the actual work.]

```gdscript
# Example code
func apply_gradient(learning_rate: float) -> void:
    for i in range(weights.size()):
        weights[i] -= learning_rate * gradients[i]
```

```yaml
# Example YAML spec
part_id: weight_wheel
display_name: Weight Wheel
spokes: 4
learning_enabled: true
```

### What I Learned

[Connect the technical work to broader AI concepts or game dev insights.]

<!-- Example: "This taught me why learning rates matter—too high and your weights oscillate, too low and training crawls." -->

## Visuals

[REQUIRED: Include at least 2 visuals]
- Screenshot of Godot editor showing the new part
- Diagram explaining the mechanic
- GIF of the part working in-game
- Before/after comparison

[Placeholder: Screenshot of X goes here]

## AI Concept Connection

[How does this week's work teach or demonstrate an AI concept?]

<!-- Example: "The Weight Wheel shows how neural networks adjust parameters during training. Each spoke is a weight that gets nudged based on error signals." -->

## Challenges & Solutions

[What went wrong? How did you fix it? Be honest—failure is instructive.]

<!-- Example: "The gradient flow visualization broke when I tried to animate it. Turns out Godot's Tween system doesn't like being called 60 times per second. Solution: batch updates every 100ms instead." -->

## Next Week

[Preview what's coming. Create anticipation.]

<!-- Example: "Next: Implementing the Entropy Manometer to visualize loss. Then we'll wire backprop together." -->

## Call to Action

**Try it yourself**: [Link to relevant code on GitHub, e.g., `game/parts/weight_wheel.gd`]
