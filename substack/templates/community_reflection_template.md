# Reader Feedback: [Topic Based on Comments/Questions]

<!-- Example: "Your Ideas for Ethical Governors" -->
<!-- Example: "What You Asked About Quantization—And What I Learned" -->
<!-- Example: "Community Poll Results: Which Feature Next?" -->

## The Hook

[Start by acknowledging reader engagement—quote a comment or question.]

<!-- Example: "Last week, three of you asked the same question: 'How will the game teach alignment without being preachy?' Great question. Here's what I'm thinking." -->

## My Responses & Updates

[Answer each theme with depth. Show how feedback is shaping development.]

### On [Theme 1]

[Your thoughtful response. Include:]
- Current thinking
- How you're incorporating feedback (or why you're not)
- Technical/design constraints
- What you need to figure out still

<!-- Example:
### On Teaching Alignment Without Preaching

You're right that this is tricky. My current approach:

1. **Mechanics first**: The Ethical Governor is a *constraint*, like a budget. It's not a moral lecture—it's a design challenge.
2. **Multiple paths**: Levels won't force one "right" answer. High alignment might cost efficiency; that's a tradeoff players navigate.
3. **Consequences, not judgments**: If your Steam-Mind fails the fairness check, the Inspectorate blocks your demo. That's a game-over, not a sermon.

Still figuring out: How to introduce bias in training data without making it feel forced.

## How This Changed the Plan

[Be specific: What decisions or implementations shifted based on feedback?]

- **Change 1**: [What you adjusted and why]
- **Change 2**: [What you adjusted and why]
- **Still Debating**: [Open questions where you need more input]

<!-- Example:
- **Change 1**: Based on your feedback, I'm adding a "tolerance knob" to the Ethical Governor so players can see the accuracy/alignment tradeoff in real-time.
- **Still Debating**: Should the game show raw bias metrics (e.g., "89% accuracy on Group A, 72% on Group B"), or abstract it into steampunk gauges? Vote in comments!
-->

## Poll Results (If Applicable)

[If you ran a poll on next features, topics, or design choices, share results]

**Question**: [What you asked]

**Results**:
1. [Option 1]: XX% (YY votes)
2. [Option 2]: XX% (YY votes)
3. [Option 3]: XX% (YY votes)

**Winner**: [Option 1] — This means [what you'll do next]

## What's Next Based on Your Input

[Preview how feedback shapes upcoming work]

<!-- Example: "Top request was quantization mechanics, so that's my next deep-dive. Expect a post on the Cog-Ratchet Press in 2 weeks." -->

## Keep the Feedback Coming

[Invite more engagement—specific questions you want input on]

**This week's question**: [Pose a new question for readers]

<!-- Example: "Which Act III level sounds more interesting: 'Keys in the Looking-Glass' (attention basics) or 'Mini-Transformer' (full block structure)?" -->
