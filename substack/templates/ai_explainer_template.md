# How AItherworks Teaches [AI Concept] with [Steampunk Metaphor]

<!-- Example: "How AItherworks Teaches Attention with Looking-Glass Arrays" -->
<!-- Example: "Backpropagation Explained Through Phlogiston Dye" -->

## The Real-World Hook

[Start by relating this to everyday AI that people use.]

<!-- Example: "Attention is why ChatGPT works—it's how the model decides which words to focus on when generating the next one." -->
<!-- Example: "Ever wonder how image recognition knows the difference between a dog and a muffin? Backpropagation." -->

## The Problem This Solves

[What challenge does this AI concept address? Why was it invented?]

<!-- Example: "Before attention mechanisms, language models treated all words equally. That's like reading every word with the same emphasis—you'd miss what matters." -->

## The Steampunk Translation

[Map the AI concept to your game mechanic. Use the established lexicon.]

### In AItherworks, [AI Concept] Becomes [Steampunk Part]

[Describe the physical game component and how it works.]

<!-- Example: "The Looking-Glass Array is a brass frame holding three lenses: Query, Key, and Value. When aetheric marbles (tokens) pass through, the Heat Lens shows which marbles are 'paying attention' to which others." -->

### The Mapping

| AI Concept | Steampunk Metaphor | Why It Works |
|------------|-------------------|--------------|
| [e.g., Attention weights] | [e.g., Heat Lens glow intensity] | [e.g., Visual brightness = importance] |
| [e.g., Query/Key/Value] | [e.g., Three glass projections] | [e.g., Three separate light paths] |
| [e.g., Softmax] | [e.g., Pressure normalization valve] | [e.g., Total pressure always sums to 100%] |

## How It Works: Step-by-Step

[Walk through the mechanic as both game system AND AI algorithm.]

### Step 1: [Action in Game]
**AI Equivalent**: [What's happening in the neural network]

<!-- Example:
### Step 1: Marble Enters Query Lens
**AI Equivalent**: Input token is projected into query space via learned matrix Q
-->

### Step 2: [Action in Game]
**AI Equivalent**: [What's happening in the neural network]

### Step 3: [Action in Game]
**AI Equivalent**: [What's happening in the neural network]

## The Math (Optional Detail)

[Formulas, equations, explanations for technical readers]

```
Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QK^T / √d_k) V
```

In AItherworks terms:
- Q, K, V = The three projection lenses
- QK^T = Heat comparison between marbles
- softmax = Pressure normalization valve
- Final multiplication by V = Focusing the aether stream

## The Puzzle: [Level Name]

[Describe the actual level that teaches this concept.]

**Goal**: [What the player must achieve]  
**Parts Available**: [List of components]  
**Constraints**: [Budget limits, space limits, etc.]  
**What You Learn**: [The key insight this level teaches]

<!-- Example:
**Goal**: From 6-token inputs, correctly output token #3  
**Parts Available**: Looking-Glass Array, Heat Lens, Matrix Frames, Residual Rail  
**Constraints**: Mass ≤ 6k cogs (params), Pressure ≤ Medium  
**What You Learn**: How attention focuses on relevant context
-->

## Why This Metaphor Works

[Reflect on what makes this a good teaching tool.]

<!-- Example: "The Looking-Glass Array works because attention IS about focus—literally. Making that visual (with glowing lens intensity) makes the abstract concrete." -->
