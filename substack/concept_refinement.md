# Refining AItherworks: How AI Helped Shape a Steampunk AI Teacher

Welcome back to the AItherworks journey! In my last post, I introduced the idea. Today, let's dive into how I refined the concept using ChatGPT – turning a vague idea into a detailed game design.

## The Initial Prompt

I started with this prompt to ChatGPT:

> I want you to design a video game that teaches how to build and train AI models. The early levels should start off with teaching core ideas (vectors, weights, forward/back prop) then move into key concepts behind modern models GAN, attention, training, reasoning, distillation, quantisation etc. 
>
> The game needs to do this with a clever visual metaphor. Like zachtronics games that map programming concepts to mechanical systems (also like Turing tumble and spntronics). 
>
> It needs to feel like playing a game - not coding. But the learning needs to be real and deep. After doing this someone should be able to build and train a model to do a specialized task. Ideally, the game system becomes a visual building env for AI design at the end (sandbox mode). 
>
> Think hard about this. Be very clever.

## First Iteration: Signals, Gears & Dye

ChatGPT came back with "SIGNALWORKS — A Factory Game for Building Minds." It proposed metaphors like signals as colored beads, weight wheels for multiplication, and error dye for backpropagation. It was solid but felt a bit generic.

## Leaning into Steampunk

To make it cooler, I iterated: "I love the concept but I want to make the components cooler. Let’s lean in to steampunk. We should have a story that plays out along the campaign which is in an alternate steampunk world where rivals are racing to build the ultimate steam mind."

The response was gold: A full steampunk lexicon (e.g., Signal Loom for vectors, Looking-Glass Array for attention), a narrative arc mirroring real AI challenges (energy scarcity, bias), and detailed level designs.

## Building Out the Narrative

From there, I switched to Cursor and fleshed out docs like about.md, lexicon.md, and act breakdowns, generating YAML specs for parts and levels.

This process showed me how AI can accelerate creative work – and it's exactly the kind of hands-on learning *AItherworks* aims to provide.

What do you think of the steampunk theme? Would you play this? Let me know in the comments!
