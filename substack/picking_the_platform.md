# Picking the Platform: Why Godot for Signalworks?

Hello again, Signalworks followers! After refining the concept, it was time to choose the tech stack. I wanted something multiplatform, LLM-friendly, high-quality, and open-source.

## The Criteria

1. Multiplatform (web, mobile, VR, Mac, PC, Linux)
2. LLM-friendly for AI-assisted development
3. Capable of high-quality games
4. Open-source or favorable license

## The Winner: Godot 4.x

Godot ticks all boxes: Native exports everywhere, Python-like scripting that's easy for LLMs, modern rendering for steampunk visuals, and MIT license.

Alternatives like Unity or Unreal were close but fell short on openness or AI-friendliness.

## Architecture Plan

- Data-driven: YAML/JSON for puzzles and parts
- Editor plugin ("Steamfitter") for AI-generated scenes
- Deterministic sim for consistent training mechanics
- OpenXR for VR

## Next Steps

With the platform set, I'm diving into prototyping the first parts. Expect updates on that soon!
