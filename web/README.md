# AItherworks Web Edition

This directory contains the Next.js wrapper for deploying AItherworks to the web.

## Quick Start

### Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the game.

### Production Build

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

## Structure

- `app/` - Next.js 15 App Router pages and components
- `public/godot/` - Exported Godot game files (generated by build script)
- `next.config.ts` - Next.js configuration with WASM headers
- `package.json` - Dependencies and build scripts

## Building the Game

The game is automatically built when you run `npm run build`. This executes:

1. `npm run build:godot` - Exports Godot game to WASM
2. `next build` - Builds the Next.js static site

To manually rebuild just the Godot game:

```bash
npm run build:godot
```

## Deployment

### Deploy to Vercel

The easiest way to deploy is via GitHub integration:

1. Push this repository to GitHub
2. Import it in Vercel
3. Set root directory to `web`
4. Deploy!

Alternatively, use the Vercel CLI:

```bash
vercel
```

For detailed deployment instructions, see [docs/web_deployment.md](../docs/web_deployment.md).

## Technologies

- **Next.js 15** - React framework with App Router
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe JavaScript
- **Tailwind CSS v4** - Utility-first styling
- **Godot 4** - Game engine (compiled to WebAssembly)

## Troubleshooting

### Game doesn't load

1. Check that Godot export files exist in `public/godot/`
2. Verify browser console for errors
3. Ensure COOP/COEP headers are being sent

### Build fails

1. Verify Godot is installed and in PATH
2. Check that export templates are installed
3. Run `npm run build:godot` separately to debug

See the full troubleshooting guide in [docs/web_deployment.md](../docs/web_deployment.md).
