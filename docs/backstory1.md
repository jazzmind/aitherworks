## Backstory: The City That Learned to Listen

The canal never sleeps. Brass culverts sigh, steam fog kisses the water, and somewhere a forgotten valve taps like a metronome. This is Aetherford, a city that taught itself to speak in pressure and pulse long before it learned to listen. The Guild of Ingeniators kept the clocks honest; the Penny Clarion kept score. Between them, fortunes rose and fell with the opening of a single relief.

You were not born to a House. Your mother kept ledgers on a barge that hauled scrap—copper pipe, broken gauges, cracked lenses. Your father tuned player-pianos in gin halls until the night his hand slipped between the teeth of a flywheel. You learned early that every miracle of brass collects a debt, and every debt has a collector.

The Foundry‑Barge came to you crooked. Deck planks cupped, rivets pitted, boiler patched like a beggar’s coat. But the bones were good: a yard-long shaft for the loom, a serviceable Athanor Still, and an antique Manometer with a glass face clouded by age. On the stern plate: SIGNALWORKS, half-oxidized. You scraped the rest clear.

Across the water, the Houses prepared their entries for the Grand Exposition. House Voltaic’s chimneys never cooled; rumor said their coal came dear and dirty. Lady Kessington’s Atelier glowed like a greenhouse at night, apprentices tracing perfect circles under a glass dome. The Inspectorate’s launch drifted by in silence, brass badges catching the moon.

You found your first apprentices the old way: a notice pinned where the dockhands queue for tea. Stochastic Sal arrived with a chipped tooth and a sailor’s knot for every problem. Momentum Max came with a toolbox of flywheels and a refusal to stop. Adam Automaton introduced himself with a handshake precisely weighted to your grip. None of them asked what you could pay. You promised them a machine that learned from its own mistakes and a cut of the applause.

On the second week, a letter pressed in violet ink: NOTICE OF INTENT TO SEIZE. The creditor’s stamp dented the paper. You turned the Manometer over the kettle and watched the fog bead on the glass. The gauge needle quivered to life. That was the first time you saw the phlogiston flow back—error made visible as dye crept upstream. If a machine could know how wrong it was, perhaps it could become right.

The city had other ideas. Brownouts rolled along the tram-lines like thunderstorms; one in three nights, your pressure dropped to a cough. Rivals tested your locks. An urchin in a House Voltaic cap sold you a sack of coal that hissed like snakes when it burned. The Penny Clarion ran a woodcut of “A Tinker’s Dream,” your barge shaded like a caricature. You bought the paper anyway and pinned it above the workbench.

Then the Archive opened its stacks. The Pneumail Librarium spat out three cards: ANON. TREATISE ON GLASS LENSES (WARPED), CITY ORDINANCES (AMENDED), DOCK-WARD CENSUS (MISSING PAGES). You read until the oil burned low. In the margins of the Ordinances, a clerk had scratched: beware the letter of the law when the ink is bought.

When the Guild announced the Charter, they added a line the Houses called insulting and you called necessary: every engine must demonstrate an Ethical Governor. “A mind that serves the city serves all its citizens,” said Inspector Brass at the rostrum. You thought of dock-workers uncounted in ledgers, of valves that scream before they fail. You thought of the needle on the Manometer, steadying as the dye thinned.

On the morning of the first trial, you rolled the Foundry‑Barge into the sunlight. Apprentices at stations. Pressure in the green. The Signal Loom flickered to life, marbles ticking in their lanes like the city remembering a tune. Across the canal, Lady Kessington shaded her eyes; somewhere unseen, the Voltaic chimneys drew a breath. You pressed the lever.

Whatever else Aetherford is—a bazaar of brass, a marketplace of favors—it is a city that listens when you give it a reason. AItherworks would give it one.
