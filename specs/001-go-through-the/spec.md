## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

A player (Mechanist apprentice) launches AItherworks and experiences a structured campaign teaching AI concepts through steampunk puzzle-solving. They progress through 6 Acts, each introducing new machine parts (AI components) and concepts (neural network techniques). As they solve puzzles, they learn how to:
1. Build neural network equivalents using steampunk parts
2. Train models by adjusting weights and parameters
3. Validate solutions against hidden test sets
4. Optimize for multiple constraints (accuracy, efficiency, cost)
5. Handle modern AI challenges (bias, alignment, compression)

After completing the campaign, players unlock a Sandbox mode where they can freely experiment with all unlocked parts, import custom datasets, and share their creations.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a new player launches the game, **When** they select "Begin Campaign", **Then** they see the backstory scene introducing Aetherford and their foundry-barge.

2. **Given** a player is on Act I Level 1, **When** they place a Steam Source, Signal Loom, and Weight Wheel and connect them, **Then** they can run a forward pass and see aetheric marbles flow through the connections.

3. **Given** a player has built a simple machine, **When** they enable training mode and run the simulation, **Then** they see phlogiston dye flow backwards and weights adjust according to gradients.

4. **Given** a player's machine meets the win conditions, **When** the Inspectorate validates on hidden test data, **Then** the level is marked complete and the next level unlocks.

5. **Given** a player completes all 28 campaign levels, **When** they access the Foundry (Sandbox), **Then** they can use all 33 unlocked parts, load custom datasets, and export their machine designs as JSON blueprints.

6. **Given** a level has budget constraints (mass ‚â§ 6000 cogs, pressure ‚â§ Medium), **When** a player exceeds these limits, **Then** the system prevents them from placing additional parts and displays constraint violations.

7. **Given** a player double-clicks a part, **When** the Spyglass inspection window opens, **Then** they see real-time data flowing through that part (vectors, matrices, attention weights, logits).

8. **Given** a player is solving a transformer level, **When** they use the Layer Navigator, **Then** they can step through attention layers, see heat lens visualizations of attention weights, and ablate specific heads.

9. **Given** a player builds a quantization puzzle solution, **When** they use the Cog-Ratchet Press to compress weights to 4-bit, **Then** accuracy metrics update in real-time showing the precision/accuracy tradeoff.

10. **Given** a player creates a machine in Sandbox mode, **When** they export as a blueprint, **Then** the system generates a JSON graph with optional PyTorch scaffold showing the neural network equivalent.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a player creates a machine with circular dependencies (feedback loops)? ‚Üí System allows recurrent connections and runs simulation until convergence or max iterations (configurable per level)
- How does the system handle invalid part connections (mismatched port types)?
- What happens if a player's machine fails to converge during training (loss increases)? ‚Üí System stops after max epochs (per level YAML) and provides adaptive hints (e.g., "Learning rate may be too high" or "Check Weight Wheel connections")
- How does the system handle extremely slow machines (performance degradation)?
- What happens when a player attempts to load a corrupted or invalid level spec?
- How does the system behave if required YAML files are missing or malformed?
- What happens when a player tries to place incompatible parts (e.g., convolution drum without input data)?
- How does the system handle edge cases in transformer trace loading (missing tokens, malformed attention matrices)?

## Clarifications Needed

**All clarifications resolved as of 2025-10-03. See research.md for decisions.**

### ‚úÖ [RESOLVED #1: Port Type System]
**Question**: What are the exact port types supported (e.g., scalar, vector, matrix, attention_weights)? How are type mismatches handled (hard error vs. warning)?

**Resolution**: Defined 8 port types in `research.md` Section 2: scalar, vector, matrix, tensor, attention_weights, logits, gradient, signal. Type mismatches show red connection line + error tooltip, with runtime assertion checks. See `contracts/part_schema.yaml` for full taxonomy.

### ‚úÖ [RESOLVED #4: Sandbox Dataset Format]
**Question**: What specific dataset formats does Pneumail Librarium support (CSV, JSON, image directories)? What are size limits?

**Resolution**: Supports 4 formats per `research.md` Section 5:
- CSV (max 10,000 rows, 50 columns)
- JSON (max 5 MB, array of objects)
- Images (PNG/JPG, max 512√ó512, 1,000 images, subdirs as labels)

### ‚úÖ [RESOLVED #5: Challenge Seals Sharing Mechanism]
**Question**: How are Challenge Seals shared between players (local file export, Steam Workshop integration, web API)?

**Resolution**: Phase 1 uses local JSON file export (`*.aitherworks_seal`) per `research.md` Section 6. Players share manually (Discord, Reddit). Web API/Steam Workshop deferred to Phase 2. See `data-model.md` ChallengeSeal entity for JSON schema.
