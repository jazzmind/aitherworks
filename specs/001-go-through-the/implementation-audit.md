# Implementation Audit: Existing vs Planned

## 1. Executive Summary

**Audit Date**: 2025-10-03  
**Auditor**: Implementation cross-reference analysis  
**Scope**: Existing game implementation vs. planned task list  
**⚠️ CRITICAL UPDATE**: User reports **"port types aren't working correctly in the current game"**

**Key Findings**:
- **11 of 33 parts already implemented** (33% complete) - **BUT MAY BE BROKEN**
- **UI ~80-90% complete** (workbench, backstory, tutorial all functional)
- **Act1Engine simulation core exists** (forward/backward pass, MSE, SGD, ReLU)
- **Steamfitter plugin missing** (only stubs - critical gap)
- **⚠️ ZERO test coverage** for existing code - **CANNOT CONFIRM CORRECTNESS**

**Impact on Task List**:
- Original Phase 3.1-3.6 tasks significantly reduced (60+ already done)
- **New Phase 3.2: Retrofit Testing** (T200-T211) - **VALIDATION, NOT DOCUMENTATION**
- **New Phase 3.2.5: Bug Fixing** (T212-T220 reserved) - **BLOCKING CRITICAL PATH**
- Net result: ~100 meaningful tasks remain (was 164)

**⚠️ CRITICAL ASSUMPTION INVALIDATED**: 
Original audit assumed existing parts are functional. User feedback indicates **port types not working correctly**. Phase 3.2 retrofit testing is now **validation testing** where **tests MAY FAIL** and reveal bugs requiring fixes before proceeding.

## 2. Pre-Existing Implementation Detail

### 2.1 Already Complete Parts (11 of 33) - **CORRECTNESS UNKNOWN**

**⚠️ WARNING**: These parts exist but have not been validated. Port types and ML semantics may be incorrect.

| Part | File | Lines | Status | Validation Needed |
|------|------|-------|--------|-------------------|
| Steam Source | `game/parts/steam_source.gd` | 159 | ⚠️ Untested | T200: Validate port types match YAML spec |
| Signal Loom | `game/parts/signal_loom.gd` | 71 | ⚠️ Untested | T201: Validate vector transformation |
| Weight Wheel | `game/parts/weight_wheel.gd` | 122 | ⚠️ **HIGH RISK** | T202: Matrix multiply vs element-wise? |
| Adder Manifold | `game/parts/adder_manifold.gd` | 79 | ⚠️ Untested | T203: Validate broadcasting logic |
| Activation Gate | `game/parts/activation_gate.gd` | 103 | ⚠️ Untested | T204: Validate activation math |
| Entropy Manometer | `game/parts/entropy_manometer.gd` | 196 | ⚠️ Untested | T205: Validate loss formulas |
| Convolution Drum | `game/parts/convolution_drum.gd` | 149 | ⚠️ Untested | T206: Validate 2D convolution |
| Aether Battery | `game/parts/aether_battery.gd` | 209 | ⚠️ Untested | T207: Validate similarity calculation |
| Display Glass | `game/parts/display_glass.gd` | 180 | ⚠️ Untested | T208: Validate port type acceptance |
| Spyglass | `game/parts/spyglass.gd` | 201 | ⚠️ Untested | T209: Validate connection mechanism |
| Evaluator | `game/parts/evaluator.gd` | 216 | ⚠️ Untested | T210: Validate win condition logic |

**Total**: 1,705 lines of untested part code

**User Report**: "Port types aren't working correctly" - likely issues:
1. Port type mismatches between YAML specs (`data/parts/*.yaml`) and implementations
2. Incorrect ML operations (e.g., element-wise when should be matrix multiply)
3. Port connection mechanism not validating types correctly
4. Type coercion happening silently, causing wrong results

### 2.2 Already Complete Simulation (Act1Engine)

**File**: `game/sim/act1_engine.gd` (106 lines)

**Implemented Features**:
- Forward pass through machine graph
- Backward pass (gradient computation)
- MSE loss calculation
- SGD optimizer
- ReLU activation

**Validation Status**: ⚠️ Untested - may have bugs if parts have incorrect port types

**Concern**: If parts have broken port types, Act1Engine may also have issues with:
- Type checking/validation during graph execution
- Port connection validation
- Data flow between parts

### 2.3 Already Complete UI (80-90%)

**Workbench** (`game/ui/workbench.gd` - 802 lines):
- ✅ GraphEdit integration
- ✅ Part palette
- ✅ Training controls
- ⚠️ Port connection validation? (may be source of port type bugs)

**Tutorial/Backstory** (complete):
- ✅ `backstory_scene.gd` (549 lines) - 6 Acts
- ✅ `story_tutorial.gd` (327 lines) - Character dialogues

**Other UI**:
- ✅ `part_node.gd` (259 lines) - GraphNode wrapper
- ✅ `inspection_window.gd` (237 lines) - Real-time inspection
- ✅ `intro.gd` (24 lines) - Main menu

**Total**: 2,198 lines of UI code

**Validation Concern**: Workbench may not be enforcing port type constraints correctly during connection.

### 2.4 Already Complete Infrastructure

| Component | File | Status |
|-----------|------|--------|
| YAML Parser | `game/sim/spec_loader.gd` (217 lines) | ✅ Production-ready |
| YAML Validator | `game/sim/spec_validator.gd` (74 lines) | ⚠️ Lenient port validation |
| Profiler | `game/sim/profiler.gd` (175 lines) | ✅ Complete |
| GUT Framework | `addons/gut/` | ✅ Installed |
| CI/CD | `.github/workflows/godot-ci.yml` | ✅ Configured |

**Concern**: `spec_validator.gd` has lenient port validation (warnings instead of errors) - may have allowed incorrect implementations.

### 2.5 Already Complete Data

- ✅ 33 part YAML specs in `data/parts/` - **SOURCE OF TRUTH**
- ✅ 19 level YAML specs in `data/specs/`
- ✅ Transformer trace in `data/traces/`
- ✅ Documentation in `docs/` (11 files)

**Critical**: Part YAML specs are the source of truth for expected behavior. Tests must validate implementations against these specs.

---

## 3. Missing Components

### 3.1 Steamfitter Plugin - **CRITICAL GAP**

**Current State**: Only stubs in `addons/steamfitter/plugin.gd`

**Missing**:
- YAML spec loading
- Scene generation from specs
- Schema validation integration
- Hot-reload support

**Impact**: Cannot author new levels in editor, must manually create scenes

**Priority**: HIGH - needed before creating remaining 22 parts

### 3.2 Remaining Parts (22 of 33)

**Still Need Implementation** (with TDD):
- Calibration Feeder, Matrix Frame, Downspout, Drop Valves
- Cog Ratchet Press, Residual Rail
- Looking-Glass Array, Heat Lens, Embedder Drum, Layer Tonic
- Token Tape, Pneumail Librarium, Plan Table, Athanor Still
- Attention Head Viewer, Logits Explorer, Sampling Controls
- Layer Navigator, Augmentor Arms, Apprentice SGD
- Ethics Governor, Output Evaluator (different from Evaluator?)

### 3.3 Test Coverage - **CRITICAL GAP**

**Current**: Only 2 basic test files
- `game/sim/tests_spec_validator.gd`
- `game/sim/tests_evaluator.gd`

**Missing**:
- Unit tests for all 11 existing parts
- Integration tests for level playthrough
- Schema validation tests
- Performance tests

**Impact**: Cannot confirm correctness of existing code. User report of broken port types confirms this gap.

### 3.4 Save/Load System

**Missing**:
- Player progress persistence
- Level unlocking logic
- Save file format
- Load game functionality

**Note**: Backstory system exists, but no progression tracking

## 6. Recommended Actions

### Immediate (Before Proceeding with Tasks)

1. **✅ Update `tasks.md`**:
   - ✅ Add "Pre-Existing Implementation" section at top
   - ✅ Mark T001-T006 as complete
   - ✅ Create new Phase 3.2: "Retrofit Testing for Existing Parts" (T200-T211) - **VALIDATION MODE**
   - ✅ Add Phase 3.2.5: "Fix Bugs Found in Retrofit Testing" (T212-T220 reserved)
   - ✅ Revise part library tasks to skip 11 existing parts
   - ✅ Reframe UI tasks from "create" to "polish"
   - ✅ Reframe simulation tasks from "implement" to "extend Act1Engine"
   - ✅ Update total task count to ~100 meaningful tasks

2. **✅ Update `plan.md`**:
   - ✅ Add "Implementation Audit" section in Summary
   - ✅ Update Phase 2 description with audit findings
   - ✅ Update Constitution Re-Check to reference audit confirmations
   - ✅ Revise task organization strategy

3. **✅ Create Retrofit Testing Tasks** (T200-T211) - **VALIDATION APPROACH**:
   - T200: **Validate** Steam Source against YAML spec (MAY FAIL)
   - T201: **Validate** Signal Loom port types (MAY FAIL)
   - T202: **Validate** Weight Wheel (matrix multiply vs element-wise?) (MAY FAIL)
   - T203: **Validate** Adder Manifold broadcasting (MAY FAIL)
   - T204: **Validate** Activation Gate math (MAY FAIL)
   - T205: **Validate** Entropy Manometer loss formulas (MAY FAIL)

   - T210: **Validate** Evaluator win condition logic (MAY FAIL)
   - T211: **Document all failures** and create bug fix tasks (T212-T220)

### Short Term (First Sprint) - **BLOCKING CRITICAL PATH**

4. **Execute Phase 3.2: Retrofit Testing** (T200-T211) - **VALIDATION MODE**:
   - Write unit tests for 11 existing parts based on YAML specs (source of truth)
   - Load part YAML specs to determine expected port types and behavior
   - Validate port types match between YAML and implementation
   - Validate ML semantics (correct operation types)
   - **Tests MAY FAIL** - this is expected and desired
   - Document all failures in `tests/retrofit_test_report.md` (T211)
   - **DO NOT PROCEED** to Phase 3.3 until all issues documented

5. **Execute Phase 3.2.5: Fix Bugs** (T212-T220, created based on T211):
   - Fix all port type mismatches between YAML specs and implementations
   - Fix all ML semantic bugs (e.g., wrong operation types)
   - Fix port connection validation in workbench UI (if needed)
   - Re-run T200-T210 tests after each fix
   - **ALL TESTS MUST PASS** before proceeding to Phase 3.3

6. **Execute Phase 3.4: Steamfitter Plugin** (T018-T025):
   - Build plugin with proper port type validation
   - Ensure new parts can't be created with wrong port types
   - This prevents future bugs like those found in Phase 3.2

### Medium Term (Second Sprint)

7. **Execute Phase 3.5: Remaining Parts** (T038-T089, revised):
   - Use TDD for all 22 remaining parts
   - Tests validate against YAML specs from the start
   - No more "retrofit" needed

8. **Execute Phase 3.6-3.10**: Extend simulation, polish UI, add save/load, integrate, polish

## 8. Next Steps

1. ✅ **Commit audit findings** to `implementation-audit.md`
2. ✅ **Update tasks.md** with revised task list
3. ✅ **Update plan.md** with audit summary
4. **Begin Phase 3.2** (T200-T211) - Retrofit validation testing
5. **Create T211 report** documenting all test failures
6. **Create Phase 3.2.5 tasks** (T212-T220) based on T211 report
7. **Fix all bugs** until T200-T210 tests pass
8. **Proceed to Phase 3.3** (Schema Validation Tests)

---

## 9. Lessons Learned

1. **Always audit existing code** before planning clean-slate implementation
2. **User feedback is critical** - "port types not working" invalidated initial audit assumption
3. **Validation testing ≠ documentation testing** - tests should validate against specs, not just document existing behavior
4. **Zero test coverage is a red flag** - untested code may have silent bugs
5. **YAML specs are source of truth** - implementations must match specs, not vice versa
6. **Port type validation is critical** - ML operations fail silently with wrong types
7. **Retrofit testing must come first** - can't build on broken foundation
