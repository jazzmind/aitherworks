# Example part definition for AItherworks
#
# This file illustrates how to define a component that can be
# referenced by puzzles.  Each part definition specifies the visual
# appearance, simulation behaviour, and port configuration for the
# part.  The Steamfitter plugin will read these definitions and
# generate corresponding scenes in Godot.

id: weight_wheel
name: "Weight Wheel"
category: basic
description: |
  A brass dial that scales the magnitude of an input signal.  Turn
  the wheel clockwise to increase the weight and anticlockwise to
  decrease it.  In machine learning terms this performs a scalar
  multiplication on a vector lane.

# Visual properties.  The path points at a mesh or scene under
# `art/` that will be instanced.  Adjust the transform or
# animation settings as needed.
visual:
  scene: "res://art/parts/weight_wheel.glb"
  scale: [1.0, 1.0, 1.0]
  rotation: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
  translation: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]

# Simulation properties.  This part multiplies an input by a
# weight and produces one output.  Additional fields can
# describe how it interfaces with the gradient system.
simulation:
  type: multiplier
  inputs: 1
  outputs: 1
  parameters:
    weight: 1.0
  learnable: true

# Ports define how this part connects to other parts in the
# spatial grid.  The coordinate system and port orientation will be
# interpreted by the plugin when placing scenes.  Use cardinal
# directions (north/east/south/west) to specify where signals flow.
ports:
  north: input
  south: output
