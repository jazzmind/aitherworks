description: |
  A brass wheel that learns by adjusting its weight. The 'brain' of your machine 
  that scales incoming signals and adapts through training. Turn the wheel to 
  adjust how much each input signal matters to the final output.

# Visual representation
visual:
  scene: "res://assets/icons/weight_dial.svg"
  scale: [1.0, 1.0, 1.0]

# Simulation behavior
simulation:
  type: multiplier
  inputs: 1
  outputs: 1
  parameters:
    weight: 1.0

# Port configuration
ports:
  north: "input"     # Input signal to be weighted
  south: "output"    # Weighted output signal

# Steampunk flavor
materials: ["brass", "iron", "copper"]
steam_pressure: "medium"
complexity: "simple"

# Teaching points
