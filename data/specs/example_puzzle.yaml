    Fresh from the Dock‑Ward, you have one day to prove yourself.
    The Guild will repossess your foundry if you cannot add two
    numbers.  A small challenge, but with steam everything hums.

# Budget constraints for the level.  These correspond to internal
# measures such as parameter count (mass), energy consumption
# (pressure) and cost (brass).  Values are arbitrary units.
budget:
  mass: 1000
  pressure: 10
  brass: 50

# A list of part IDs allowed in this puzzle.  These IDs should
# correspond to part definitions under data/parts/.
allowed_parts:
  - weight_wheel
  - adder_manifold
  - activation_gate

# Win conditions define the criteria for success.  The simplest
# condition is achieving a target accuracy on a hidden validation set.
win_conditions:
  accuracy: 0.95

# Training parameters for the level.  This section can be used to
# configure optimizers and learning rates if you wish to override
# defaults.  Optional.
